📘 Go Language Basics – Practice Programs
This repository contains a collection of beginner-level Go programs designed to demonstrate core programming concepts. These files serve as a foundational exercise set for learning the Go programming language.

📁 File Overview
File Name	Description
hello.go	A simple “Hello, World” program to test your Go setup.
variables.go	Demonstrates variable declarations, constants, data types, and formatted output.
operators.go	Showcases arithmetic, logical, relational, bitwise, and assignment operators.
conditional.go	Includes if-else and switch statements to evaluate conditions based on marks and days.
loop.go	Demonstrates different types of loops (for, while, infinite with break, continue).
functions.go	Covers custom function creation, return values, and multiple return values with blank identifiers.
slice.go	Works with arrays, slices, append, make, and map operations (key-value pairs).

✅ How to Run
Make sure Go is installed. Then, you can run any file using:

bash
'''
Copy
Edit
go run <hello.go>
'''
